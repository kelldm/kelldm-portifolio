              I'm Raquel, a 23 year-old student at INFNET College in Rio
              de Janeiro. Currently in my second semester, I am deeply passionate
              about technology and innovation. My heart lies in the realm of User
              Experience (UX) design, where I find joy in crafting seamless digital
              experiences. <br/> I am fueled by curiosity, particularly in the field of
              Artificial Intelligence (AI), and I aspire to delve deeper into its
              intricacies one day. I'm on the lookout for an internship opportunity
              where I can not only apply my existing skills but also foster new ones. <br/>
              My journey in the world of technology is just beginning, and I am
              excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. Let's connect and
              explore how we can create innovative and user-centric solutions
              together.
