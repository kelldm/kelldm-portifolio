                         I'm Raquel, a 22-year-old student at INFNET College in Rio
                        de Janeiro. Currently in my second semester, I am deeply passionate
                        about technology and innovation. My heart lies in the realm of User
                        Experience (UX) design, where I find joy in crafting seamless digital
                        experiences. <br/> I am fueled by curiosity, particularly in the field of
                        Artificial Intelligence (AI), and I aspire to delve deeper into its
                        intricacies one day. I'm on the lookout for an internship opportunity
                        where I can not only apply my existing skills but also foster new ones. <br/>
                        My journey in the world of technology is just beginning, and I am
                        excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. Let's connect and
                        explore how we can create innovative and user-centric solutions
                        together.
